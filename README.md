## Project Overview

The aim of this project is to predict loan status using machine learning techniques. The classification model is built using logistic regression and evaluated using various performance metrics.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project consists of loan data with associated features and loan status labels. The features include borrower information, loan details, and other relevant attributes. The loan status labels indicate whether a loan is classified as "Healthy" or "High Risk".

## Installation

To run the code in this repository, you need to ensure you have the following dependencies installed:

- Python
- scikit-learn
- imbalanced-learn
- pandas
- numpy

You can install the required dependencies by running the following command: pip install -r requirements.txt


## Usage

1. Start by cloning this repository: git clone https://github.com/bauzaj/credit-risk-classification.git

2. Navigate to the project directory: cd credit-risk-classification

3. Prepare your dataset and update the necessary configurations in the code.

4. Run the main script to perform the loan status classification



## Results

After running the classification script, the model will be trained using logistic regression on the provided dataset. The performance metrics, including precision, recall, and F1-score, will be computed for each class (Healthy and High Risk) and presented in a classification report.

The classification report summarizes the model's performance and provides insights into the precision, recall, and F1-score for each class, as well as overall accuracy.
